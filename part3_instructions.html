<h3>Experiment PRADPT1 - Part 3 (final part)</h3>

<p>Welcome back to our experiment.  In order to participate in this experiment, you need to be a native speaker of American English (i.e. you must have moved to the U.S. before the age of 6 and you must have lived there most of your life).</p>

<p>In this final part of the experiment, you will again describe pictures, as in Part 1.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, please take a moment to read our consent form (we have to provide this to you for each part of the experiment). The consent form is identical to that of Part 1 and 2.</p>

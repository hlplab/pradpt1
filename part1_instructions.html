<h3>Experiment PRADPT1</h3>

<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. Your input will help us to understand how our brain processes and produces language.  In order to participate in this experiment, you need to be a native speaker of American English (i.e. you must have moved to the U.S. before the age of 6 and you must have lived there most of your life).</p>

<p>The experiment has three parts which have to be taken on different days. Before you continue please make sure that you will be able to follow the required schedule.</p>

<p>Here's a quick overview of the three parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Part 1: You will describe about 60-80 simple pictures (one sentence each).</li>
    <li>Part 2: You will read 80 short excerpt from transcribed dialogues about a variety of topics and answer questions about the content of these excerpts.</li>
    <li>Part 3: You will describe another 60-80 simple picture (one sentence each).</li>
</ul>

<p>Schedule and payment (payment is progressive, so that this task is really worth it if you complete all parts):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Please take Part 1 today ($2 for about 30 minutes)</li>
    <li>Please take Part 2 in two days, i.e. after one intervening day ($6 for about 1 hour).</li>
    <li>Please take Part 3 {% if now == true %}IMMEDIATELY (WITHIN 5 MINUTES){% else %}TWO DAYS{% endif %} after Part 2 ($7 for about 30 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be reminded after each part of the experiment what you need to do next. It is important that you complete the parts in the order and the schedule given above since we will not be able to use the data provided by you otherwise. At the end of each part of the experiment you will be given a code to paste into the HIT on Mechanical Turk to verify that you completed that part. This code will also be required in order to be allowed to do the next part of the experiment.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, please take a moment to read our consent form (we have to provide this to you for each part of the experiment):</p>
